# Queues

## What is a Queue?

* A _Queue_ is an ordered line or sequence.
* Exactly like _stacks_ but they are different in how the data enters or leaves them.
* Many of the D.S are built on top of the _Queue_ data structure.

## Queue Characteristics

* FIFO - First In First Out rule applies with a _queue_.
* Four basic ways to interact with a _queue_ include:
    * enQueue - Insert data.
    * deQueue - Delete data.
    * Search - You can also search for something in the queue.
    * Access - You can also access something in the queue.

## Big O Notation for a Queue

* enQueue - 0(1)
* deQueue - 0(1)
* Search - 0(n)
* Access - 0(n)

## Stack vs Queue

* A _Stack_ is LIFO (Last In First Out).
* A _Queue_ is FIFO (First In First Out).
